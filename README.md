# üß© CSL 411 ‚Äì Compiler Lab

---

## üìò Overview
This repository contains all the programs and experiments for the **CSL 411 Compiler Lab**.  
It also includes **extra programs** beyond the official syllabus.

---

## üß† Objective
To understand the design and implementation of the major components of a compiler using **C**, **LEX**, and **YACC**, including lexical analysis, parsing, syntax-directed translation, intermediate code generation, and optimization.
